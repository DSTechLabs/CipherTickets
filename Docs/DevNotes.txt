            Concept : Create "virtual" Tickets for the website.
                      Each ticket has four secret codes (alphanumeric strings that are on physical objects in the U.S.)
                      Puzzles are played/solved to reveal Clues to the location of the Codes
                      Codes are entered into website to Win a Ticket and its secret Prize
                      Prizes are worth at least $20
                      Develop web site to show current Tickets and Code Clues
                      New Tickets are added often to keep traffic up
                      Site use is free to use, charge for advertising on site
